*  Description of the program
*******************************************************

The program "Dijkstras Algorithm"  is an
implementation of the Link-State-Routing Algorithm.
Dijkstra's algorithm was used to solve the single source to
the shortest path problem for a graph.

Name:  main.cpp
   Main program.  
   This is the driver program that calls functions
   to read data from an input file, use the data make a new file,
   and print an output.

*******************************************************
*  Circumstances of programs
*******************************************************

   The program runs successfully.

   The program was developed and tested on CLion 2017.1.1.
   It was compiled, run, and tested on macOS Sierra.

*******************************************************
*  How to build and run the program
*******************************************************

1. Uncompress the homework.  The homework file is compressed.
   To uncompress it use the following commands
       % unzip [PatriciaFigLab03]

   Now you should see a directory named homework with the files:
        main.cpp

2. Build the program.

    Change to the directory that contains the file by:
    % cd [PatriciaFigLab03]

    Compile the program by:
    % make

3. Delete the obj files, executables, and core dump by
   %./make clean
